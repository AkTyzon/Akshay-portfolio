## 💼 Experience

### **Machine Learning Engineer – Cybersecurity Analytics**  
**Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT)** | Aug 2023 – Present  

- Designed and implemented an **LLM-powered natural language query system** that:
  - Enabled analysts to query **PostgreSQL and OpenSearch** using plain English  
  - Used schema-aware prompting to generate structured queries  
  - Converted query results into **natural-language summaries** for faster investigations  
- Built and deployed **endpoint network bytes anomaly detection pipelines**, analyzing per-process and per-host network behavior to identify suspicious activity at scale.
- Developed a **masqueraded process detection system for Windows endpoints** using **rule-based techniques**:
  - Maintained a curated allowlist of legitimate system process paths  
  - Detected lookalike malicious binaries using **Levenshtein distance** on process names  
- Owned **end-to-end pipelines**, including feature engineering, deployment, and monitoring in a Linux-based production environment.

**Impact:** Systems deployed in a **national-scale cybersecurity environment**, supporting live threat detection and investigation workflows.
